# 一些挑战性的“亮”星系

都听说过传说中的巴纳德星系NGC6822，光看星等挺亮，但其实观测这个不容易的。像这种欺骗性的星系还有什么？

  

从首席观测师的记录中，我找到了几个类似的目标，仅供参考。认真一看，这些目标比梅西耶级别的M33难多了。

C5-马费伊1星系群、巴纳德、C51、C17、C18、C3 应该都是一些矮星系或者被尘埃遮蔽的目标，视面较大而表面较暗。特别是马菲1
马菲2这种，都是著名的暗大头。

烟花C12我看过，其实还算是比较容易的。巴纳德C57观测多次未果。其他的貌似都没看过。

前面俩IC都不容易。大王乌贼、双胞胎、小墨西哥帽都比较暗是没想到的，光从星等上看好像都是善茬。这些也会日后的观测中进行进一步描述……
